## REST_API

I used flask to create this rest api and used sqlite for storing the data.

API that I've created, they are following:

### "/users" - To get the fetch the data and used post method in it to send the data to server.
### "/user/<int:id>" - To get the particular data of an user with their id and can edit the data of that user and delete as well.
### "/search/<first_name>" - To search any user with their first name.
### "/api/users" - In this api, I've performed some sorting, filtering and pagination.
